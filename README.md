# Image-Classification-using-ViT
This code implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The Vision Transformer is a novel neural network architecture that has shown success in various computer vision tasks. The code involves data preprocessing, defining the ViT model, and training it on a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset
